# php_js_ImageViewer

php_js_ImageViewer is an image viewer that makes thumbnails, links them to the fullsize image, and allows for panning and accurate zooming, centered on the cursor. 

Put the php files together in, let's say, 'someFolder';
Make a folder in 'someFolder', let's say, 'imageFolder';
Make a folder in 'imageFolder', which must be called 'thumbs';
Put your fullsize images alone in the folder called 'imageFolder;
Edit the 3 php files, thumbsU.php, imageViewerU.php, and deleterU.php, to make the path to 'someFolder' point to the actual name you chose for this folder;
